To do

- moving pieces in the d2408 game do not behave correctly
- test the memory game with size 4 by 5
- test the maze eample with size 20 by 15
- include grid x and grid y when drawing a piece
- use ImageData to convert an image to a matrix of pixels and use the matrix in p_art
- add sound to the crash example
- add images to the memory example
- add keyboard events to move cars in the rush example
- add images to the rush example
- add sound to the rush example
- add a possibility to create a new parking in the rush example
- why some circles are partially out of canvas (south only) in the bounce example?
- draw a cloud within a shape (polygon, regular polygon) in shapes
  (see Bezier Curves in doc/links.txt)
- add methods from Point and Rectangle (MutableRectangle) to Position and Box
- add hashCode and equality (==) to the Position, Size, Box, MinMaxSize and MinMaxSpace classes

  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19713572/how-do-i-compare-two-lists-as-being-equal-and-containing-the-same-objects-in-da
- add detris (tetris) based on the datris example
- add snake example
- add parity example
- add how many squares example (4 by 4 grid): sum of squares 1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2  + 4^2 = 30;
  you can generalize this to n(n+1)(2n+1) / 6 for any nXn square.

- add a game of life example
  http://jimmy.rocketware.co.uk/dart/game-of-life/
- see Dart Games at http://ondart.me/web_programming.md for more examples
- add the magic boxes example
- add a network layout example

- write a document about the boarding poackage
- create more generic view components
- create even more examples to increase the generic stuff (see HTML5 & JS Games in doc/links.txt)
- do view tests with a web test library

Maybe

- use Point instead of Position? 
- make Size and Box unmutable? 

New Games

- create a random number of moving squares (moving pieces) of random sizes per color,
  where each color represents one song (no visible signs which song)
