    <h1>Crash</h1>
    <p>
      Move the mouse to move the red car.
      The goal is to avoid collisions with other cars.<br/>
      If the red car is hit (it becomes smaller and black),
      a new car is added.<br/>
      Use the small, black car to hit other cars to propel them.<br/>
      Click on the small, black car to revive it to the red car.
